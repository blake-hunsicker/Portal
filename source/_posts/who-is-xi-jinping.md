Xi Jinping is at the heart of the peace negotiations between North Korea and the West. As leader of China, he inherited the country's historical position as the North's main trade partner since the collapse of the Soviet Union.

What Xi decides to do (or not do) will have large ramifications for Korea and the United States.
