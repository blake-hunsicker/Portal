There hasn't been any real fighting on the Korean peninsula since 1953, but the Korean War never officially ended because the leader of South Korea at the time (name: Syngman Rhee) believed he could push farther north.

Generals from North Korean, the United States and China signed the 1953 armistice of Panmunjom without him.
