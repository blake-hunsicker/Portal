The US's [State Sponsors of Terror list](https://www.state.gov/j/ct/list/c14151.htm), which imposes strict sanctions on designated countries, currently lists Iran, Syria, Sudan and North Korea. It was originally drafted in 1979. North Korea has a storied history as a member:

**On**

North Korea was first put on the list in 1988 because, among other actions, it:

* Carried out an assassination attempt against then-South Korean president Chun Doo-hwan in Rangoon, Burma in October, 1983. It is known as the Rangoon bombing. 21 people died.
* Bombed a passenger flight between Baghdad and Seoul in November, 1987. 115 people died.

**Off**

President George W. Bush removed North Korea from the list in 2008.

**Back on**

President Trump re-added North Korea in November, 2017. Below are some events leading up to Trump's decision to re-add the county:

* The alleged state-sponsored murder of Un's half brother, Kim Jong-nam. Nam was poisoned with the nerve agent VX in Malaysia.
* The North Korean government launched a missile that flew directly over Hokkaido, Japan in August, 2017.
