Why did Kathleen Cleaver, the wife of a high ranking member of the Black Panther Party (BPP), give birth in Pyongyang, North Korea?

"Today, the DPRK is an earthly paradise, with an advanced socialist system, highly developed technology, a brilliant national culture and a healthy people," her husband, Eldridge Cleaver, wrote after visiting North Korea in 1969.

The relationship between the BPP and the DRPK, cultivated during Eldridge's time in Algeria, is one example of Kim Il-Sung's vast global outreach efforts during the Cold War that put his country in contact with Puerto Rican separatists, Che Guevara and Fidel Castro, the Palestinian Liberation Organization, and the Irish Republican Army.

"Given the present day reality of North Korea as an isolated and impoverished nation, it may seem absurd that the nation could ever have been perceived as a Third World model worthy of emulation. However, from the early 1960s to the mid-1970s, North Korea was more prosperous than South Korea and became an industrial power in the communist bloc."
