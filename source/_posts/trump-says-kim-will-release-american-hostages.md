The prisoners were released at the end of SoS Mike Pompeo's most recent visit to Pyongyang on May 9, 2018.

The video above shows the released prisoners as they were greeted by Trump at Andres Air Force Base in the early morning hours of May 10.

“I want to thank Kim Jong-un,” Trump said to reporters on the tarmac. “I think he wants to do something and bring that country into the real world.”

"We would like to express our deep appreciation to the United States government, President Trump, Secretary Pompeo, and the people of the United States for bringing us home," the three said in [a joint statement released by The State Department](https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2018/05/281997.htm).
