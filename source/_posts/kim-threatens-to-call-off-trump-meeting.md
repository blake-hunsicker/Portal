Kim Jong-Un cancelled a scheduled meeting with South Korean officials Wednesday and threatened to call off his highly expected meeting with President Trump in June over ongoing US-South Korean military exercises.

"This exercise targeting us, which is being carried out across South Korea, is a flagrant challenge to the Panmunjom Declaration and an intentional military provocation running counter to the positive political development on the Korean Peninsula," The Korean Central News Agency said.

The military exercises are scheduled to continue for two weeks.
