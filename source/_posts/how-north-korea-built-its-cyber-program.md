US and British officials say North Korean government-led hacking operations stole an upwards of $1 billion in 2017. Besides serving as a lifeline to the country's crippled economy, North Korea's 6,000 hackers are used as an arm of the government's propaganda wing, targeting international outlets, like Sony Pictures and Britain's Channel 4, that mock the image of Kim Jong-Un.

“You could argue that they have one of the most successful cyberprograms on the planet, not because it’s technically sophisticated, but because it has achieved all of their aims at very low cost," Chris Inglis, a US Security expert, said at a conference earlier this year.
