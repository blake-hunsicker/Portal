Pompeo made headlines recently after becoming the highest level US official to visit North Korea in decades.

Pompeo is the 70th Secretary of State. His predecessor, Rex Tillerson, was fired by President Trump in March.

Pompeo was Director of the CIA from 2017 to 2018. He was nominated by President Trump.

Before that, he served in Congress from 2011 to 2017 in Kansas's 4th District.
