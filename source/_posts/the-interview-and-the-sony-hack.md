Perhaps most famous recent spat between North Korea and the outside world was the hacking of Sony Pictures in 2014, and Sony's decision to cancel the release of a movie making fun of Kim Jong-Un.

Some believe was instigated by North Korea in response to the upcoming release of _The Interview_, a comedy that made fun of the country.
