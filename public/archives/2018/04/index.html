<p>The prisoners were released at the end of SoS Mike Pompeo’s most recent visit to Pyongyang on May 9, 2018.</p>
<p>The video above shows the released prisoners as they were greeted by Trump at Andres Air Force Base in the early morning hours of May 10.</p>
<p>“I want to thank Kim Jong-un,” Trump said to reporters on the tarmac. “I think he wants to do something and bring that country into the real world.”</p>

His status was unknown until a CNN crew <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/01/11/asia/north-korea-alleged-us-detainee/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed him in Pyongyang in January, 2016.</a> He was put on trial later that Spring for espionage and charged to ten years hard labor.</p>
<p><strong>Tony Kim</strong>, a 59-year-old professor living in China, taught at Yanbian University of Science and Technology, near the North Korea border. He also taught at times at the university’s sister school, Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST). He was detained in the airport on his way to the United States on April 22, 2017. He was accused of “Acts of hostility.”</p>
<p><strong>Kim Hak-Song</strong>, an agriculture consultant, was also affiliated with PUST. He was detained two weeks after Tony Kim was arrested.</p>

<p>“Given the present day reality of North Korea as an isolated and impoverished nation, it may seem absurd that the nation could ever have been perceived as a Third World model worthy of emulation. However, from the early 1960s to the mid-1970s, North Korea was more prosperous than South Korea and became an industrial power in the communist bloc.”</p>

<p>US and British officials say North Korean government-led hacking operations stole an upwards of $1 billion in 2017. Besides serving as a lifeline to the country’s crippled economy, North Korea’s 6,000 hackers are used as an arm of the government’s propaganda wing, targeting international outlets, like Sony Pictures and Britain’s Channel 4, that mock the image of Kim Jong-Un.</p>
<p>“You could argue that they have one of the most successful cyberprograms on the planet, not because it’s technically sophisticated, but because it has achieved all of their aims at very low cost,” Chris Inglis, a US Security expert, said at a conference earlier this year.</p>
