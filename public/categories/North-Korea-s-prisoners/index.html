<p><strong>Kim Dong-Chul</strong>, a naturalized American citizen in his mid-60s, was detained in 2015. His status was unknown until a CNN crew <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/01/11/asia/north-korea-alleged-us-detainee/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed him in Pyongyang in January, 2016.</a> He was put on trial later that Spring for espionage and charged to ten years hard labor.</p>
<p><strong>Tony Kim</strong>, a 59-year-old professor living in China, taught at Yanbian University of Science and Technology, near the North Korea border. He also taught at times at the university’s sister school, Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST). He was detained in the airport on his way to the United States on April 22, 2017. He was accused of “Acts of hostility.”</p>
<p><strong>Kim Hak-Song</strong>, an agriculture consultant, was also affiliated with PUST. He was detained two weeks after Tony Kim was arrested.</p>

<p>The prisoners were released at the end of SoS Mike Pompeo’s most recent visit to Pyongyang on May 9, 2018.</p>
<p>The video above shows the released prisoners as they were greeted by Trump at Andres Air Force Base in the early morning hours of May 10.</p>
<p>“I want to thank Kim Jong-un,” Trump said to reporters on the tarmac. “I think he wants to do something and bring that country into the real world.”</p>
<p>“We would like to express our deep appreciation to the United States government, President Trump, Secretary Pompeo, and the people of the United States for bringing us home,” the three said in <a href="https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2018/05/281997.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a joint statement released by The State Department</a>.</p>
