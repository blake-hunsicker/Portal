<p><strong>Cuba:</strong> Since reestablishing diplomatic relations in 2015, relations have not improved between the US and Cuba. Lorem ispum dolor. The United States recently accused Cuba of attacking the US Embassy in Havana with “an acoustic device” that sickened 22 US Diplomats.</p>
<p><strong>Iran:</strong> The United States formally began easing sanctions on Iran after the 2015 nuclear deal. President Trump pulled out of the deal last week. Analysts worry that this move will antagonize his efforts to broker peace with North Korea.</p>

        <p>Why did Kathleen Cleaver, the wife of a high ranking member of the Black Panther Party (BPP), give birth in Pyongyang, North Korea?</p>
<p>“Today, the DPRK is an earthly paradise, with an advanced socialist system, highly developed technology, a brilliant national culture and a healthy people,” her husband, Eldridge Cleaver, wrote after visiting North Korea in 1969.</p>
<p>The relationship between the BPP and the DRPK, cultivated during Eldridge’s time in Algeria, is one example of Kim Il-Sung’s vast global outreach efforts during the Cold War that put his country in contact with Puerto Rican separatists, Che Guevara and Fidel Castro, the Palestinian Liberation Organization, and the Irish Republican Army.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>“Given the present day reality of North Korea as an isolated and impoverished nation, it may seem absurd that the nation could ever have been perceived as a Third World model worthy of emulation. However, from the early 1960s to the mid-1970s, North Korea was more prosperous than South Korea and became an industrial power in the communist bloc.”</p>

It was originally drafted in 1979. North Korea has a storied history as a member:</p>

<p>North Korea was first put on the list in 1988 because, among other actions, it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Carried out an assassination attempt against then-South Korean president Chun Doo-hwan in Rangoon, Burma in October, 1983. It is known as the Rangoon bombing. 21 people died.</li>

<ul>
<li>The alleged state-sponsored murder of Un’s half brother, Kim Jong-nam. Nam was poisoned with the nerve agent VX in Malaysia.</li>
<li>The North Korean government launched a missile that flew directly over Hokkaido, Japan in August, 2017.</li>
